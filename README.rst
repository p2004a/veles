Building, installing
--------------------

Dependencies:

- ``cmake`` >= 3.1.0
- ``zlib``
- ``qt`` >= 5.5
- ``Python3``
    - ``virtualenv``

Caveats:
``qt`` >= 5.6 is required if you want to rearrange tabs using drag&drop.

Optional dependencies needed for running tests:

- ``gtest``

If your distribution has -dev or -devel packages, you'll also need ones
corresponding to the dependencies above.

On Ubuntu it can be done like this::

    apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev qtbase5-dev g++ python3 python3-virtualenv 


To build ::

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ make

To install [which is optional], use ::

    $ make install

If you want to install to a non-default directory, you'll also need to pass
it as an option to cmake before building, eg.::

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ..
