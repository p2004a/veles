## 2017.05.0.Świtezianka (2017-05-12)

### Major features and changes:

  * Introduced client-server architecture:
    * The server can run remotely and can be shared amongst many users.
    * The server is currently written in Python 3.
    * There's a possibility to script Veles using both Python 2 and 3, but currently without a support for any GUI operations.
  * Created an instalator for Windows, added a support for DEB packages and a drag and drop installer for macOS.
  * Dropped official 32-bit Windows support, due to problems with MessagePack.
  * Keep current state in a database file.

### Minor features and changes:

  * Added more encoders in hex view ("Copy as" context menu).
  * Added connection dialog.
  * Lowered minimum macOS version to 10.10.
  * Moved 3D view control panel to a horizontal bar.

### Bugfixes:

  * Fixed a glitch in 3D view mouse manipulation.
  * 3D views which are not currently visible don't use CPU/GPU resources anymore.
  * Fixed minor stability issues.

### Caveats:

  * Python3 (>= 3.5) is now needed to run Veles on macOS and has to be manually installed.
  * To install Veles from DEB package on Ubuntu you need to enable "universe" repository (it is normally enabled by default, but not on live CD).
  * Hotkeys from the top menu don't work on Ubuntu 16.\* due to a Qt bug:
    * This is already fixed in Qt, but 16.\* have old Qt in repo.
    * Bug description: https://bugs.launchpad.net/appmenu-qt5/+bug/1380702
    * You can circumvent the bug by running Veles with the following environment variable set: UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=""

## 2017.01.0.MechanicalTurk (2017-01-26)

### Major features and changes:

  * Added network protocol that allows using external scripts as ad-hoc parsers. Added a simple Python library to support using this functionality. Check out python/README.rst for details.
    * For security reasons network server is disabled by default and has to be enabled in the options dialog.
    * This feature is still in an early phase of development and the API will change in future releases.
  * Added a few parsers for well known file formats (avi, bmp, elf, gif, pe, mov, zip). New parsers have been generated from Kaitai template files (https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct). Support for user-provided Kaitai files is planned in upcoming releases.
